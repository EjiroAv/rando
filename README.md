**Rando is and Android App Based on the Popular Number Guessing Game where the computer Generates a Random number and the User has to Guess what that Number is.**

>I started the Project to familiarise myself with some of the Aspects of Android Development and also to improve my Programming Skills.
>The challenge for me was to see How much I can Improve on the Initial Number Guessing Game Algorithm

## Feautures
> Custom Hints Besides the traditional "Number is Lower/higher than Player Input"
> Custom Animation for Game Load (Learnt a Lot about Threading here)
> I also Optimised the app to be able work like regular apps by adding functions such as Hide Keyboard when the activity is touched and so on.

*It's not a Big Project But it was fun working on it.*
